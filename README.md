# StockX AI â€“ Intelligent Stock Price Forecasting Platform 

**StockX AI** is an advanced stock market forecasting web application that combines deep learning techniques (LSTM) with technical indicators such as RSI, MACD, and Moving Averages to generate accurate and actionable stock price predictions. Developed using Streamlit, the application offers an interactive, real-time experience tailored for data analysts, investors, and financial researchers.

## Key Features

* Real-time stock data integration via **Yahoo Finance**
* Next-day closing price prediction using a pre-trained **LSTM model**
* Technical indicators visualization:

  * Moving Averages (MA50, MA100, MA200)
  * Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  * Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
* Model performance evaluation using:

  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  * RÂ² Score
* Deployed with **Streamlit** for a smooth and responsive user interface

## Sample Output

| Metric                         | Value                       |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE)      | \$11.36                     |
| Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) | \$14.30                     |
| RÂ² Score                       | 0.9109 (Excellent Accuracy) |

**Predicted Closing Price:** \$508.30
**Evaluation Period:** Microsoft (MSFT), 2015â€“2025

## How It Works

1. The user provides a stock ticker and date range.
2. Historical data is retrieved using the `yfinance` API.
3. Technical indicators are computed using the `ta` library.
4. Data is preprocessed and passed into a pre-trained **LSTM** model.
5. The model predicts the next closing prices and visualizes actual vs. predicted results.
6. Performance metrics are calculated and displayed on-screen.
